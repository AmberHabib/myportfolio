I created this animation to understand the formation and spread of new religious groups over time across the globe. It took a lot of time to make this plot, from scraping the data from [the source](https://religiondatabase.org/browse/regions) to creating an interactive visualization with the aim of accomodating as much information as possible in a single animation.
